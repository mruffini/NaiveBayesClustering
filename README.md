## Content of the project:

### RandomDataGenerator.py

A module that allows the user to generate synthetic Naive Bayes Models with Bernoulli outcomes

### CoreFunctions.py

A module that contains the core functions 


### TestScript.py

A script to generate synthetic Naive Bayes Models using the module "RandomGenerator", perform clustering
 using the module "CoreFunctions" and compare the results with k-means.
